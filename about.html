      <h1>The <q>Big Idea</q></h1>
      <p>Dr. Ken (founder & owner of ALco.) read B.J. Palmer’s ‘Big Idea’ during his first year in chiropractic college. Instantly, his vision grew. One brick-and-mortar clinic was not enough. One clinic would not create the impact and change that this world so desperately needs. The result? Reimagining health care and the impact of on-site wellness programs.</p>

        <h1>Healing Philosophy</h1>
        <p><i>This section highlights how we see the world, and more importantly, our lens through which the human body operates, survives, and thrives</i></i></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your body is designed to heal itself</li>
        <li>The nervous system (brain, spinal cord, all nerves) controls all function in your body. The brain is your ‘master control center’ and communicates with all parts of your body via nerves, giving and receiving trillions of messages to keep everything in proper coordination.</li>
        <li>This system can be interfered with by daily stress (physical, chemical, and emotional), which causes decreased connection between your brain and body</li>
        <li>Interference within the nerve system limits your body’s ability to heal and perform. With decreased connection between brain and body, your body is unable to function as it is designed to. It is no longer able to operate in a state of ease and harmony.</li>
        <li>ALco. chiropractors analyze, reduce, and remove the stress and interference that has built-up along your spine over time; Restoring the connection between your brain and body and allowing proper communication and transmission of all incoming and outgoing messages. The result? Restoration of normal; where “normal is brilliant”.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Our promise –</b><i> when you get off the table after an adjustment, your body WILL be working better than when you first laid down</i></p>

    </div>
    <div class="bigIdea">
      <div class="bigLeft">
        <h1>The “Big Idea”, revised</h1>
        <address>Dr. Ken Wilson, owner & founder of Awaken Life Company</address>
        <p>When stress and interference is reduced and removed from the spine, your body heals, performs, and functions better</p>
        <p>When your body performs and functions better, you feel better</p>
        <p>When you feel better, you can focus and work better</p>
        <p>When more people feel, focus and work better… the physical, mental, and economical welfare of a company is increased</p>
        <p>When you multiply the welfare of one company, you increase the welfare, value, and efficiency of a state</p>
        <p>When you multiply the efficiency of a state, you produce a healthier and wealthier nation</p>
        <p>So…<br><br>

          To reduce and eliminate the stress and interference upon the spine, to restore proper connection from brain to body, to restore health, to bring about a better way of living and working, to multiply those results within one company, to multiple those companies across the nation… is big enough to change and rebuild the thoughts, actions, and welfare of the world.
          <br><br>
          This idea is the biggest I know of.</p>
